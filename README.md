# Pipeline Implementation of MIPS32 processor with reduced instruction set
This is the Capstone project of the course ["Hardware Modeling Using Verilog"](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs60/preview) by professor [Indranil Sen Gupta](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~isg/). I created a [wiki](https://github.com/stativeboss/MIPS32/wiki) for the background theory required to understand the code.


This repo the verilog code, the test-bench, and the results obtained after simulation.
